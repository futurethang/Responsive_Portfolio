                <p>Hello, thanks for visiting my site! I am a tech professional located in Seattle Washington, with an extensive background in Design, IT, Audio Visual services, and small enterprise environments. I received my BA from Valparaiso University in graphic design, and spent 11 years in Chicago gaining experience in several aspects of commercial business.</p>

                <p>I’ve worked extensively with sales teams, developing resources and best practices while managing CRM systems, SQL database query, and calculating innovative metrics to drive sales department success. </p>
                    
                <p> While working for a rapidly growing Audio Visual and Technology rental agency I pivoted to meet the needs of a nimble and fast paced environment, taking on roles in inventory management, vendor relations, marketing, and IT. </p>
                    
                <p> Here in Seattle I am the co-founder of a unique walking tour experience called the <a href="http://overlookedarttour.com/">Overlooked Art Tour</a>, and play a role in <a href="http://stormprintcity.com/">Storm Print City</a>, an ongoing print-making venture that creates art and provides programming for youth and adult groups to get engaged and make art from found objects in urban spaces.</p>
                    
                <p>  I am currently the Lead Media Technician at the University of Washington’s Medical Research campus in South Lake Union, overseeing in-house meeting technology and video conferencing systems for a wide range of student, faculty, and board member stakeholders. </p>
                    
                <p> In my spare time I provide print and digital freelance graphic design services for institutions and individuals, and learn or write new songs to play on my guitar. And for what its worth, I’m an <a href="http://www.astrology-zodiac-signs.com/zodiac-signs/aquarius/">Aquarius</a>. </p>
